## What is Akita?

Drop-in API monitoring, no code changes necessary.

Built for busy developer teams who don't have time to become experts in monitoring and observability, Akita is the
fastest, easiest way to see and monitor your API endpoints which makes it possible to quickly track API endpoints and
their usage in real time.

* **See API endpoints.** Automatically get a searchable map of your API endpoints in use. Explore by latency, errors,
  and usage. Export as OpenAPI specs.
* **Get drop-in API monitoring.** Get a drop-in view of volume, latency, and errors, updated in near real-time. Set
  per-endpoint alerts.
* **Quickly understand the impact of changes.** Keep track of the endpoints you care about and identify how new
  deployments impact your endpoints.

Simply drop Akita into your system to understand your system behavior, without having to instrument code or build your
own dashboards.
